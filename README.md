## 🚀 What Does This Project Do?

- **Detects fake reviews** on e-commerce platforms using Logistic Regression.
- Utilizes a rich set of features:  
  - **Metadata** (reviewer info, timestamps, etc.)
  - **Linguistic features** (text analysis, sentiment, etc.)
  - **Normalization techniques** for robust results.

## 🧑‍💻 Try It Yourself! (Get Interactive)

- **Explore the notebook:**  
  Dive into the code and see how each feature contributes to the detection process.
- **Interactive visualizations:**  
  Play with the data, tweak parameters, and watch how the model responds in real time!
- **Test with your own reviews:**  
  Paste in a review and instantly see if our model thinks it’s real or fake.
- **Challenge the model:**  
  Try to write a review that fools the detector—can you outsmart the algorithm?
- **Vote and discuss:**  
  Share your results and opinions in the Discussions tab. What features do you think matter most?
